# Analyzing-Country-Data-Using-SQL-and-Pandas
This is a guided project from DataQuest.io (online platform to learn Data Analysis and Data Science).

Our dataset is from CIA World Factbook and contains statistical data (area, population, birth rate, etc) about all countries in the world.

The data and code in Part I was part of the course. Part II is my original work.
